## About The Project

The rapid proliferation of IoT devices has outpaced security, leaving networks exposed to widespread attacks. Devices are frequently deployed with critical vulnerabilities such as weak default credentials, unpatched firmware, and insecure open ports.

IoT Sentinel addresses this challenge by providing a centralized, automated, and proactive defense. By creating a high-speed communication channel between the network's data and control planes, this framework can intelligently:

* **Discover:** Automatically discover active hosts on the network by learning from traffic.
* **Scan:** Dispatch a suite of security scanners to identify insecure open ports, weak credentials, and other vulnerabilities.
* **Remediate:** Automatically deploy fixer scripts to harden weak passwords, apply firewall rules, and block threats at the network level with dynamic Access Control Lists (ACLs).
* **Report:** Present all findings and actions on a centralized web dashboard and send consolidated email notifications to administrators.

---

## Project Architecture

The framework is built on a modular architecture composed of several key components:

* **POX SDN Controller:** The central brain of the system, running a custom Python module (`mqtt_monitor.py`) that orchestrates all security logic, including traffic analysis, host discovery, and fixer/scanner dispatch.
* **Mininet Network Emulator:** Creates a realistic virtual testbed that emulates a network of vulnerable IoT devices, switches, and services.
* **Scanners & Fixers:** A collection of standalone Python scripts designed to perform specific tasks, such as scanning for open ports (`iot_scanner.py`) or changing weak passwords (`ssh_fixer.py`).
* **Flask Web API Backend:** A lightweight Python server that acts as the bridge between the POX controller and the web UI. It serves data from log files generated by the controller.
* **React Frontend:** A modern, single-page web application that provides the user with a real-time dashboard to monitor events, view logs, and see a dynamic visualization of the network topology.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

This project is designed to run within a Mininet virtual machine.
* Mininet VM (with Python 3.8+ installed)
* Node.js and npm
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository into your home directory:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/IoTSentinel.git](https://github.com/your_username/IoTSentinel.git)
    cd IoTSentinel
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

---

## Usage

To run the full application, you will need to open four separate terminal windows.

**1. Start the POX Controller**

In the first terminal, start the POX controller. It must be running before Mininet is started.
```sh
cd ~/pox
./pox.py misc.mqtt_monitor
```

**2. Start the Flask Backend**

In the second terminal, start the Flask API server.
```sh
cd ~/IoTSentinel
python3 main.py
```

**3. Start the React Frontend**

In the third terminal, start the React development server.
```sh
cd ~/IoTSentinel/client
npm run dev -- --host
```
After it starts, take note of the `Network:` URL provided (e.g., `http://192.168.X.X:5173`).

**4. Start the Mininet Network**

In the fourth terminal, start the network simulation.
```sh
cd ~/topologies 
sudo python3 iot_topo.py
```
Once the `mininet>` prompt appears, the network is running and has connected to the POX controller.

**Accessing the Dashboard**

Open a web browser on your host machine (not inside the VM) and navigate to the `Network:` URL provided by the React server in Step 3. You should now see the IoT Sentinel dashboard. The system will perform its first scan automatically after a short delay.
